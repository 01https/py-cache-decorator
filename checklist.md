# Ð¡heck your code against the following points:

1. **CODE EFFICIENCY:** don't call the same function several times, store result and use it.

Bad example:
```python
animals = "cat, dog, rabbit"
print(animals.title())

for letter in set(animals.title()):
    if animals.title().count(letter) > 1:
        print("wow")
```
Good example:
```python
animals = "cat, dog, rabbit"
animals_title = animals.title()
print(animals_title)

for letter in set(animals_title):
    if animals_title.count(letter) > 1:
        print("wow")
```
2. **DON`T REPEAT YOURSELF:** write your code so that you don't 
   have duplicated lines or whole blocks of code.

Bad example:
```python
if "cat" in animal_list:
    print("found")
    print("the end")
else:
    print("not found")
    print("the end")
```
Good example:
```python
if "cat" in animal_list:
    print("found")
else:
    print("not found")

print("the end")
```
3. **CODE STYLE:** use descriptive and correct variable names.

Bad example:

```python
ls = [1, 2, 3, 4]
rs = 0
for a in ls:
    rs += a
```

Good example:

```python
list_of_numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4]
result = 0
for number in list_of_numbers:
    result += number
```

4. **CODE STYLE:** use one quotes style in your code. 
Double quotes are preferable.
5. **CLEAN CODE:** you don't need `nonlocal` statement 
   when you change mutable object in inner function.
6. **CLEAN CODE:** when you write your code you can add comments, 
   prints, functions to check your solution and so on. 
   Don't forget to delete all this when you are 
   ready to commit and push your code.
